      <title>Two Critiques of the Proposed Social Work Licensure Compact</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Council of State Governments (CSG), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) have partnered to draft an interstate licensure compact for social workers. The Compact is currently available in draft for &lt;a href=&#34;https://compacts.csg.org/compact-updates/social-work/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreffer &#34;&gt;public comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many professions have interstate compacts allowing work and life to flow across State lines. Some large organizations (such as the VA) already accept out-of-State licenses. The proposal, as written, would undoubtedly make the practice of social work significantly easier for many social workers. However, the proposal does not meaningfully support new social workers or macro workers. It also fails to protect all social workers from the piling on of many (many) fees across States, but letting States squeeze underpaid social workers for cash is perhaps a requirement if we want something like the Compact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
